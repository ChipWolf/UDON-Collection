**PlayerManager v1.0**

Purpose: Give every player a personal object they own and send custom network events to specific players.<br/>
Complexity Level: High

*SETUP:* Drag and drop the '[THH_PlayerManager]' prefab from the Prefabs folder into your scene. Add a PlayerHandler prefab as a child of the manager.
Unpack both prefabs and add your system to the handler. Now duplicate the handler as many times as you need it (Maximum Players * 2 + 1 to be safe).
